# In Academia
These describe the upper/lower/tight bounds for runtime
* Big O: upper bound on time
* Big Omega: lower bound on time
* Big theta: tight bounds, both O and Omega === industry "big O"

# Best, Worst, Expected
These cases describe the big O time for particular inputs/scenarios
## Example: Quick sort
* Best: O(n) - all elements equal
* Worst: O(n^2) - reverse sorted array, with pivot as 1st element
* Expected/Average: O(n log n)

# Space complexity
Also includes the call stack
